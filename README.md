## What is Momentum?
Momentum is an open source Unity game asset focused on providing a movement framework that can be easily modified and extended. The movement is Celeste inspired with tight fluid controls and aims to be simple but effective. This simplicity and extendibility allows your creativity to sculpt your game rather than compromising with prebuilt functions.
